# Project Title: Boltgram

#### Video Demo: [https://youtu.be/j-u6RHfwI5k](https://youtu.be/j-u6RHfwI5k)

For my final project in Harvardâ€™s CS50 course, I created **Boltgram**, a social network inspired by Instagram but tailored to reflect my personal tastes and interests. This project highlights my skills in both backend and frontend development, incorporating key features such as user authentication, media uploads, and user interaction with posts.

### Technologies Used:
- **Backend**: Ruby on Rails with JSON data storage
- **Frontend**: JavaScript, CSS for dynamic and responsive UI
- **API Integration**: Cloud services for media storage
- **Deployment**: (add if applicable, e.g., Heroku)

### Key Features:
1. **User Authentication**: A secure login and registration system with password encryption.
2. **Post Creation**: Users can upload photos, add captions, and interact with posts via likes and comments.
3. **Feed**: A dynamic feed displaying recent posts from other users.
4. **Profile Pages**: Customizable user profiles showcasing uploaded posts.
5. **Responsive Design**: The app is designed to work well on both desktop and mobile devices.

### Security Considerations:
The **application.yml** file, which contains sensitive API keys (such as for media storage and authentication), is not included in this repository to comply with GitHub's policies and ensure the security of the application. All sensitive configurations are handled via environment variables.
